# Fake-URLs-Detection-System

#Goal Of this Application:

The goal of this application is to use machine learning algorithms
such as Random Forest, Light GBM, and XG Boost to detect
and classify different types of URLs accurately. In addition
to the goals previously mentioned, the overall goal of the
application is to develop and evaluate a machine-learning algorithm
capable of accurately identifying and classifying malicious
URLs, including phishing, malware, and defacement URLs.
This research aims to provide a reliable and efficient method
for detecting and preventing malicious URLs, thereby ensuring
online safety and security for the internet user.

#Data Set Description: 

The dataset that we have used in this research consists of
651,191 URLs, categorized into four types: Benign, Malware,
Phishing, and Defacement URLs. The majority of the URLs
(428,103) are benign or safe to browse, while the rest of
the URLs are classified as 96,457 defacement URLs, 94,111
phishing URLs, and 32,520 malware URLs. Benign URLs refer to safe-to-browse websites, such as popular search engines
or social media platforms, while malware URLs inject harmful
software into a victimâ€™s system upon accessing the URL.
Defacement URLs are created by hackers with the intent to
replace the original hosted website with its own content, while
phishing URLs aim to steal sensitive information, such as login
credentials and financial data. To provide further insight into
the dataset, a word cloud has been generated for each type of
URL

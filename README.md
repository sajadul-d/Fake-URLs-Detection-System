🔒 Detecting Malicious URLs: Safeguarding Online Security with Machine Learning 🚀

📋 In this study, our primary aim was to develop and evaluate a machine learning algorithm capable of detecting and classifying various types of URLs, including malicious URLs like phishing, malware, and defacement URLs.

🔍 The dataset consisted of 651,191 URLs classified into four types: Benign, Malware, Phishing, and Defacement URLs. Among them, 428,103 URLs were classified as benign, while the remaining URLs were categorized as 96,457 defacement URLs, 94,111 phishing URLs, and 32,520 malware URLs.

🔒 Benign URLs belonged to reputable sources such as popular search engines and social media platforms. 🦠 Malware URLs injected harmful software, 🎭 defacement URLs aimed to replace hosted websites with unauthorized content, and 🎣 phishing URLs sought to deceive users into providing sensitive information.

💡 To gain further insights, we created word clouds or each URL category, revealing common words and phrases associated with each type. These word clouds provided valuable information for developing a robust method to detect and prevent malicious URLs, ensuring online safety and security.

⚙️ Our research showcased the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Light GBM, and XG Boost, in accurately classifying URLs. The Random Forest classifier achieved an impressive accuracy of 97%, while the Light GBM and XG Boost classifiers achieved accuracy rates of 96% and 96.2%, respectively.

🌐 These results highlight the potential of machine learning in accurately detecting and classifying malicious URLs, contributing towards a safer online environment. By leveraging these algorithms, we can enhance online security and protect users from threats.
